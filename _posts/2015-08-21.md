The following is how I setup the github papges.

Basically, I followed the steps given at [https://pages.github.com/]. For the user papges, you need to create a repo as `username.githup.io`. For the project pages, you need to create a branch called `gh-pages` under you project repo. The procedures are quite clear at [https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/].
