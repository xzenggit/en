I like github. Really. 

Sometimes, I need to use two different accounts, and I don't want the two accounts related. Then, I found this [post](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574), which is quite useful and clearly on setting up two accounts for github. 

It helps a lot to me.
