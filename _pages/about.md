I'm Xiangming Zeng, currently a Phd Candidate of Physical Oceanography in North Carolina State University. 

My work is combing data and models to understand and predict the variation of ocean status. In my spare time, I like hiking, visiting museums, watching movies, and exploring data and web related new techniques. You can find more information about me and my work at [here](xzenggit.github.io).

This blog is my personal notebook. I hope you will find it useful too!

Enjoy! :smiley:
