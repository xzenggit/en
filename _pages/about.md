Hello, I'm Xiangming Zeng, currently a Phd Candidate of Physical Oceanography in North Carolina State University. My work is combing data and models to understand and predict the variation of ocean status.

In my spare time, I like hiking, visiting museums, watching movies, and exploring data and web related new techniques. You can find more information about me and my work [here](http://xzenggit.github.io).

This blog is my personal notebook. I hope you will find it useful too!
