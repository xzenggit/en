Hello, Iâ€™m Xiangming Zeng, currently a Phd Candidate of Physical Oceanography at North Carolina State University. My work is combing data and models to understand and predict the variation of ocean status.

In my spare time, I like hiking, visiting museums, watching movies, and exploring machine learning and web related new techniques. You can find more information about me and my work [here](http://xzenggit.github.io), and reach me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zengx) or [xzengemail at gmail.com]().

This is my personal notebook. I hope you will find it useful too!
